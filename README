This part of the Empower Project consists of supporting interoperability between the Software products of DISystemer company and implements the Semantic Adaptation Layer (SAL) of the Empower Project.

The user Types of The Empower SAL project are two. The Vendor and Organization.

The Vendor type is responsible of adding the software components , create the web services and operations per software components and finally assign to them the schemas (xsd).

After adding the input and output schemas the vendor can annotate the operations the schemas belong to and the data (ComplexTypes) they contain.

During the operation annotation the vendor defines the semantic taxonomy the operation belongs to. This is necessary so as to help the organization to do bridging between the input / output schemas that belong in the same taxonomy.

During the data annotation is realised an upcasting for the input schema or downcasting for the output schema to the XBRL canonical taxonomy.

After the data and operation annotation is created the cvp and the schemas are then available for bridging.

The organization userType can access all the software components and choose one web service/input operation/schema. When choosing it , he get all the semantically coherent output schemas available for bridging. He chooses the desired one and creates the cpa entity.

Using the cpa's that belong to him he can introduce an xml that respects the input schema and get the target xml.
